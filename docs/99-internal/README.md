# Internal Notes

This section is for notes meant for maintainers, AI assistants, and future developers—not for general onboarding.

## Purpose

Internal documentation that doesn't fit the narrative flow but is useful for:

- AI assistants (Cursor, Copilot, GPT) understanding context
- Future maintainers needing implementation details
- Development notes and reminders

## Documents

Currently empty. Add internal notes here as needed.

## When to Read

- When working with AI assistants that need project context
- For maintainer-specific implementation details
- For notes that don't belong in user-facing documentation
